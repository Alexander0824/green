This program has been developed as part of an undergraduate thesis project on the hydrogenation of vegetable oil. 
The program utilises a simulated annealing algorithm and models the breakdown of triglycerides into hydrocarbon green fuels. 

'polynomials.py' contains the program used to derive the unique NASA Polynomials for the vegetable oils based on 'data'.
'main_v1.py' contains the simulated annealing algorithm and will output potential solutions. 

Change 'oil_type' and 'T_set' in 'main_v1' to adjust reaction reactants and conditions.
